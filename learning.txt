I have learned how to create and manage repositories on GitHub, including organizing projects and tracking changes effectively. I now understand how to use branches to isolate work without affecting the main project and how to open pull requests to propose and review changes collaboratively. Additionally, I have practiced committing changes with clear messages and reviewing commit history to monitor progress and understand how a project evolves over time.
